# Flow List

Â¿Have you ever felt the urgent need to display your favourite flows all together in a nice component? Me neither. At least, until today. But now you can solve all your problems with Lightning Flows thanks to this component.

## Description

Since flows are not objects, you cannot show a ListView directly, so we use a Custom Object called `Flow__c` (huehue) to store a reference of the flow itself. For every flow to show in the component, you must create a new Flow object and indicate a name (to be shown) and the **unique name** of the flow (the standard one).

## Setup Instruction

All you have to do is install the package and let the magic _flow_ (pun intended). After that, the component will be available to be used in the Lightning Builder or in the Community Builder.
